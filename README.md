# The Potatoes Project
## A Dimentional Analysis Language

... WORK IN PROGRESS ...

With it's starting point being a university project for the discipline of Formal Languages and Automata,
the first objective was to create a simple dimentional analysis language that could define the arithmetics
with diferente units. The objective grew to include the ability to accept the equivalence of units that could be accepted
in calculations in diferente dimentions.
